# README.md

This application is a simple blog-like website developed as an initial study project to learn web development.

It has been developed on nodejs with express, mongoose, handlebars and passport, following all the guidance provided by [Victor Lima](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJ_KhUnlXUPtbtLwaxxUxHqvcNQndmI4B).

There are several UI/UX and QA issues, as well as security flaws. This application is not intended to be used as an end-product.

Ideally, next steps would include improving input/data validation, managing access control and other functionalities in order to fix the knowledge and techniques acquired.
